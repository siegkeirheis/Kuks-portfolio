          <p>
            I am a full stack developer with 5 years of experience and have done both server and client development.
            I was in charge of the computer system in a financial institution, and I developed the application with an IBM server and developed a mobile website.
            <br>I have also worked as a project manager, so I am very interested in software engineering.

            He was a very passionate and diligent employee. I worked with him for three years, 
            and he always met the project deadlines and the results were also very high quality. 
            He was especially faithful to the rules and regulations.

        <div class="recommendation">
          <span>&#8220;</span>
            He was someone who got along really well with people. He was in the middle of the team, 
            but he got along well with both his superiors and subordinates, 
            and none of them said anything bad. He's a great guy, both technically and personally.

        </div>
        <div class="recommendation">
          <span>&#8220;</span>
            He has a lot of knowledge about new technologies in IT. 
            It is possible because he spent more time with more interest than others. 
            He tends to make any sacrifices for new knowledge.
